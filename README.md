# Paint

Simple Painting program made using C Programming Language.  
This program *does not* use any Drawing Libraries and is completely text-based.  
  
The cursor is moved using `↑` `↓` `←` `→` arrow keys.  
Desired color is applied on the cursor position using keys `1` through `9`.  
Color can be removed using the `E` key and the canvas can be cleared using the `0` key.  
  
This program simply utilizes the ASCII character █ (alt + 219) and colors it using the `textcolor()` function.
